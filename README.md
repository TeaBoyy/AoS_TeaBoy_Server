### Grenade launchers
Makes your gun shoot grenades instead of bullets!

How to setup:
1. Add `grenade_launchers.py` script to your `scripts` folder (or `feature_server/scripts`): https://github.com/TeaBoyy/AoS_TeaBoy_Server/blob/main/scripts/grenade_launchers.py
2. Add `"grenade_launchers"` to your config.txt in `scripts` JSON array.
3. Done.

Optional:
1. You can set `"nade_launcher_restore_blocks" : false` in your config.txt to allow restoring blocks on grenades impact. 
Hold `V` and shoot to restore destroyed blocks!
